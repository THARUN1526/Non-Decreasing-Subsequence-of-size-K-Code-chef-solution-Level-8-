The problem states  an array `A` consisting of `N` non-negative integers and a positive integer `K`. You need to find the lexicographically smallest sequence `B` that satisfies the following conditions:

1. We can obtain `B` by rearranging the elements in `A`.
2. The length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of `B` is equal to `K`.

If there is no such sequence `B` that satisfies the conditions, you should output `-1`.

In other words, you need to find the smallest rearrangement of the array `A` that has a non-decreasing subsequence of length `K`. The lexicographically smallest sequence refers to the sequence that comes first when comparing sequences in lexicographical order.

To solve the problem, you need to consider all possible rearrangements of the array `A`. For each rearrangement, you check if it has a non-decreasing subsequence of length `K`. If such a sequence is found, it is the lexicographically smallest sequence that satisfies the conditions.

The constraints of the problem are:
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 200: the number of test cases
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 200: the length of the array `A`
- 1 ≤ K ≤ N: the length of the required non-decreasing subsequence
- 1 ≤ A[i] ≤ N: the non-negative integers in the array `A`
- The sum of `N` over all test cases doesn't exceed 200.
